  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed a huge surge in the number of ransomware attacks. Different institutions such as healthcare, financial, and government have been targeted. There can be numerous reasons for such a sudden rise in attacks, but it appears working remotely in home-based environments (which is less secure compared to traditional institutional networks) could be one of the reasons. Cybercriminals are constantly exploring different approaches like social engineering attacks, such as phishing attacks, to spread ransomware. Hence, in this paper, we explored recent advances in ransomware prevention and detection and highlighted future research challenges and directions. We also carried out an analysis of a few popular ransomware samples and developed our own experimental ransomware, AESthetic, that was able to evade detection against eight popular antivirus programs.},
